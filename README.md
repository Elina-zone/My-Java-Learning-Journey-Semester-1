# Java Lab Projects
This repository is a collection of my early Java learning work—simple, practical, and beginner-friendly. It includes the core topics I’ve practiced while building my programming foundation.

(1)Basic Java programs to understand fundamentals

(2)If-else and switch statements for learning decision-making.

(3)For, while, and do-while loops to practice repetition and logic building.

(4)Math, character, and string method exercises to explore built-in functions.

(5)User-defined methods to write clean, reusable code.

(6)Programs demonstrating 1D arrays for storing and processing linear data.

(7)Programs using multidimensional arrays to handle matrix-like structures.

(8)File handling examples for reading from and writing to files.

(9)Exception handling exercises to manage runtime errors gracefully.

(10)Programs demonstrating recursion to solve problems using self-calling methods.

"This repo is my step-by-step journey of learning Java—one concept, one program, and one lab task at a time."
